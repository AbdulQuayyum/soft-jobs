We strive to create the best experience by focusing on Asynchronous communication. What is Asynchronous communication?\n\nAsynchronous communication is any type of communication where one person provides information, and then there is a time lag before the recipients take in the information and offer their responses.\n\nHow can we utilize the time lag:\n\nSince we are eliminating the need for calls with documentation, this time can be utilized for effective time management giving you enough time to complete the tasks in working hours.\n\nSince it is documented you have records of each and every question/doubts/process no need to go back and ask the same thing twice now.\n\nThis time lag can also be utilized for doing some home activities or playing a sport or simply listening to one of the episodes of our Podcast - The Shape of Work\n\nBeing in an asynchronous mode of communication asks dedication and commitment from each of the team members. We expect the commitment towards the same from all team members by responding to slack messages in a timely manner and being responsive over emails. Present all information on Slack without the need for second-guessing and extrapolation from other team members.\n\nWherever there is a need for synchronous communication with team members, coordinate well in advance and block each other's calendars to minimize scheduling conflicts.\n• *Perks:**\n\n- To feel the ease of working from home/anywhere setup cost to INR: 50,000 (Furniture and headphones) + addition of INR 5,000 on completion of every year.\n- Health Insurance- Unlimited free virtual doctor consultations with various specialities. Covers all the family members\n- Mental Wellness sessions and webinars\n- High speed internet with reimbursements upto INR 1,500 per month\n- Learning & Growth budget of ($300) for each individual & the annual bonus of INR 10,000 on hitting learning targets\n- 24 Annual Paid Leave\n- Yearly OTT platform reimbursements upto INR 1,500\n- Health policy for gym membership, healthy snacks or just staying fit. Reimbursement upto INR 1,000 per month.\n- Furlenco corporate discount and subsidized rental.\n- Indwealth subsidized rental.\n- Reward and Recognition programme (Monetary)\n- Birthday and Anniversary vouchers.\n- Company outings to celebrate success together (**Subject to Covid protocols)\n- Reimburse Workation trip upto INR 15,000 year",
